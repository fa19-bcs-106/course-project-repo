# Project Name: Veggies Party whoop whoop

## About:

- Are you fed up with tasteless fruits and vegetables from the supermarket?
- Are you concerned about climate change and want to support the local producers?

Through our project, we would like to change consumption patterns by creating an online platform connecting farmers and clients without involving big supermarket chains.

Intermediaries take most of the money in the process and farmers can be forced to sell their products under their production costs.

Choosing the short circuit, you support local and sustainable agriculture while improving the quality of life for farmers and reduce our footprint on the planet.

We create a link between farmers and customers with an online platform that remove intermediary who takes most of the money in the process.

## How does it work:

This application would display various farmers' profiles around a given location and allow the user to buy fresh and seasonal food.

#### Farmer:

1. Create an account:

- Create a Profile: photos, biography, information about his farm etc..
- Create a Stock: add new item or remove the sold one
- Track Orders: dispatch or talk with the clients

#### User:

- Create an account: name, address, payment method...
- Access a page with local farmers, display their profil and products when selected (remove and add item to cart...)

## Benefits:

- Reasoned diet (seasonal food)
- Less transport (local)
- No intermediary between farmers and customers: more money for farmers and better food quality for clients

## Profit:

We ask farmers money to register and use our application (we can make profit and assure farmers to have a better deal than before with large retailers).
